Overview [#overview]
*********************
Haystack defines a fixed set of data types we call *kinds*.

There are three special singleton types:
  - [Marker]`#marker`: label for a "type" or "is-a" relationship
  - [NA]`#na`: singleton value that represents not available, missing, or invalid data
  - [Remove]`#remove`: singleton value that represents a removal operation

There are eleven scalar atomic types:
  - [Bool]`#bool`: boolean "true" or "false"
  - [Number]`#number`: floating point number annotated with an optional unit of measurement
  - [Str]`#str`: string of Unicode characters
  - [Uri]`#uri`: Universal Resource Identifier
  - [Ref]`#ref`: reference  used to identify an entity instance
  - [Symbol]`#symbol`: name constant used to identify a def
  - [Date]`#date`: an ISO 8601 date as year, month, day: 2011-06-07.
  - [Time]`#time`: an ISO 8601 time as hour, minute, seconds: 09:51:27.354.
  - [DateTime]`#dateTime`: an ISO 8601 timestamp followed by timezone name
  - [Coord]`#coord`: geographic coordinate in latitude/longitude
  - [XStr]`#xstr`: extended typed string

And there are three collection types:
  - [List]`#list`: linear sequence of zero or more items
  - [Dict]`#dict`: hashmap of name/value pairs
  - [Grid]`#grid`: two dimension table

Each of these kinds is discussed in further detail below.

Names [#names]
**************
Names used for dict tags and grid columns are restricted to the
following characters:

  - Must start with ASCII lower case letter (a-z)
  - Must contain only ASCII letters, digits, or underbar (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)

By convention we use camel case (fooBarBaz) for generating names.  Restricting
names ensures they may be safely and easily used as identifiers in programming
languages and databases.

Marker [#marker]
****************
Marker is a singleton used to create "label" tags.  Markers are used to
express typing information.  For example the `equip` tag is used on any
dict that represents an equipment asset.

Encodings:
  M                     // Zinc cell
  name without colon    // Zinc meta, nested dict, Trio
  { "_kind": "marker" } // JSON

NA [#na]
********
NA is a singleton for not available.  It fills a similar role as the 'NA'
constant in the R language as a place holding for missing or invalid data
values.  In Haystack it is most often used in historized data to indicate
that a timestamp sample is in error.

Encodings:
  NA                // Zinc, Trio
  { "_kind": "na" } // JSON

Remove [#remove]
****************
Remove is a singleton used in dicts to indicate removal of a tag.  It is
reserved for future HTTP ops that perform entity updates.

Encodings:
  R                     // Zinc, Trio
  { "_kind": "remove" } // JSON

Bool [#bool]
************
Bool is the truth data type with the two values 'true' and 'false'.

Encodings:
  T or F           // Zinc, Trio
  true or false    // JSON boolean

Number [#number]
****************
Number is an integer or floating point value with an optional unit of
measurement.  Implementations should represent a number as a 64-bit IEEE 754
floating point and provide 52 bits of lossless integer representation.

All Haystack Numbers may include an optional unit of measurement.  This
unit must be a symbol defined in the standard [unit database]`Units`.

Encodings:

  // Unitless in Zinc, Trio, JSON are just simple numbers
  45             // unitless integer
  -23.45         // unitless floating point
  5.4e-7         // unitless exponent format

  // Zinc, Trio append unit using a literal syntax
  45°F           // integer with unit
  -23.45m²       // floating point with unit
  10_000         // underbar is allowed as a separator
  5.4E+8kW       // exponent format with unit

  // JSON uses an object for numbers with a unit
  { "_kind": "number", "val": 45, "unit": "°F" }
  { "_kind": "number", "val": -23.45, "unit": "m²" }
  { "_kind": "number", "val": 5.4E+8, "unit": "kW" }

The three special Number values:

  // Zinc, Trio use a literal syntax
  NaN
  INF
  -INF

  // JSON uses object syntax
  { "_kind": "number", "val": "NaN" }
  { "_kind": "number", "val": "INF" }
  { "_kind": "number", "val": "-INF" }

It is invalid for NaN to include a unit.  A unit may be included with
INF and -INF, however it is discouraged.

Str [#str]
**********
Str is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters.  Implementations must
fully support at least the Basic Multilingual Plane (plane 0), which covers
all the 16-bit code points.  All text formats must be encoded using UTF-8
unless explicitly specified otherwise (such as via a charset parameter in
an HTTP Content-Type).

Strings are encoded using double quotes and C style backslash escapes:
  "haystack"         // Zinc, Trio, JSON
  "Line 1\nLine 2"   // Zinc, Trio, JSON with backslash escape newline

Note that Zinc and Trio require the "$" character to be backslash escaped.

Strings are also used for enumerated types.  Enumerations define their
range via the `enum` type.

Uri [#uri]
**********
Uri is the data type used to represent Universal Resource Identifiers according
to [RFC 3986]`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986`.

Encodings:
  // Zinc, Trio use back tick quotes
  `http://project-haystack.org/`

  // JSON
  { "_kind": "uri", "val": "http://project-haystack.org/" }

Ref [#ref]
**********
Refs are the data type for instance data identifiers.  All entities are
identified via the `id` tag and a unique ref data value.  Relationships
cross-reference the entity with ref tags.  And, operations such as the 'read'
or 'hisRead' ops will identify the entity with its ref id.

Refs must adhere to the following limited set of ASCII characters:
  - ASCII lower case letter a-z
  - ASCII upper case letter A-Z
  - ASCII digit 0-9
  - Underbar "_"
  - Colon ":"
  - Dash "-"
  - Period "."
  - Tilde "~"

Haystack does not prescribe any specific format for refs.  Client software
must treat refs as opaque identifiers.  It is suggested that implementations
generate their refs as UUIDs to discourage their use as anything other than an
opaque id; the 'dis' tag should be used for human display names.

The scope of uniqueness for a ref is based on the contextual dataset.  If
working with a flat file of Haystack data, then the ids are guaranteed unique
only within that data set (such as RDF blank nodes).  When working with the
HTTP API, then refs must be unique within the endpoint.  It must never be assumed
that refs are globally unique.

Refs are encoded using "@" as a prefix and may optionally include
the display name of the entity with a quoted string literal:

  @foo-bar                  // Zinc, Trio
  @foo-bar "Display Name"   // Zinc, Trio with display name

  // JSON
  { "_kind": "ref", "val": "foo-bar" }

  // JSON with display name
  { "_kind": "ref", "val": "foo-bar", "dis": "Display Name" }

Symbol [#symbol]
****************
Symbols are the data type for [def]`Defs` identifiers.

Symbols follow the same naming conventions as [refs]`#ref` - only ASCII letters,
digits, underbar, colon, dash, period, or tilde.  Although only a subset of these
punctuation characters are used today.  Dashes are used for [conjunct symbols]`Defs#conjuncts`
and the colon is used for [feature key symbols]`Defs#keys`.

Symbols are encoded using "^" as a prefix:

  ^elec-meter  // Zinc, Trio

  // JSON
  { "_kind": "symbol", "val": "elec-meter" }

Date [#date]
************
Date is an ISO 8601 calendar date.  It is encoded as YYYY-MM-DD:

  2020-07-17   // Zinc, Trio

  // JSON
  { "_kind": "date", "val": "2020-07-17" }

Time [#time]
************
Time is an ISO 8601 time of day.  It is encoded as hh:mm:ss.sss:

  14:30:00    // Zinc, Trio for 2:30pm

  // JSON
  { "_kind": "time", "val": "14:30:00" }

DateTime [#dateTime]
********************
DateTime is an ISO 8601 timestamp paired with a timezone name.  Haystack
requires all timestamps to include a timezone.  Timezone names are standardized
in the [timezone database]`TimeZones` (city name from zoneinfo database).
Implementations should support DateTime precision at least down to the millisecond.

The encoding of DateTime is the ISO 8601 representation followed by a space
and the timezone name:

  2020-07-17T16:55:42.977-04:00 New_York  // Zinc, Trio
  2020-07-17T23:30:00Z                    // May omit UTC timezone if offset is Z

  // JSON
  {  "_kind": "dateTime", "val": "2020-07-17T16:55:42.977-04:00", "tz": "New_York" }

Coord [#coord]
**************
Coord is a specialized data type to represent a geographic coordinate as
a latitude and longitude.  Haystack uses a special atomic type for coordinates
to optimize historization of geolocation for transportation applications (versus
a collection data type such as dict).

Latitude and longitude are represented in [decimal degrees]`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees`.
Implementations should support precision down to the micro-degree (6 decimal
places) which provides accuracy to ~100mm and can be packed into a 64-bit
integer.

Coord is encoded using positive/negative latitude, longitude in decimal degrees:
  C(37.5458266,-77.4491888)   // Trio, Zinc

  // JSON
  { "_kind": "coord", "lat": 37.548266, "lng": -77.4491888 }

XStr [#xstr]
************
XStr is a tuple of a "type name" and string encoded value.  The type name
must follow [tag naming]`#names` rules except it must start with an ASCII
upper case letter (A-Z).  XStrs provide a mechanism for vendors to round trip
specific string encoded atomic values.  The type name is not currently
standardized by Project Haystack.  However it should be assumed that future
versions of this specification may standardize a set of XStr type names.

Encodings:
  Type("value")   // Zinc, Trio
  Color("red")    // Zinc, Trio

  // JSON
  { "_kind": "xstr", "type": "Color","val": "red" }

List [#list]
************
List is a collection data type.  Lists are ordered sequences and may contain
any other valid Haystack data types.

Lists are encoded using square brackets exactly like JSON arrays:
  [1, "two", 3]    // Zinc, Trio, JSON
  []               // empty list

Dict [#dict]
************
Dict (or dictionary) is the primary collection data type in Haystack.  Dicts
are an unordered collection of name/value pairs that we call *tags*.  The
name keys of a dict are restricted to ASCII letters, digits and underbar
as discussed in the [names section]`#names`.  The values may be be any other valid
Haystack data type.

Dicts are encoded using curly braces similiar to JSON objects:
  {x:123, y:456}       // Zinc, Trio (commas optional, trailing comma allowed)
  {"x":123, "y":456}   // JSON object

Grid [#grid]
************
Grid is a two dimensional tabular data type.  Grids are essentially a list
of dicts.  However, grids may include grid level and column level meta data
that is modeled as a dict.  Grids are the fundamental unit of data exchange
over the [HTTP API]`HttpApi`.

Grids are commonly used to encode a list of dicts into a single table.
Consider three dicts that model buildings:

  id: @site-a
  dis: "Site A"
  site
  area: 45000ft²

  id: @site-b
  dis: "Site B"
  site

  id: @site-c
  dis: "Site C"
  site
  area: 62000ft²
  phone: "(804) 555-1234"

Our three entities all have an 'id', 'dis', and 'site' tags.  In addition, two
have the 'area' tag, and one has a 'phone' tag.  To combine these three entities
into a grid we end up with five columns and three rows:

  id       dis       site  area      phone
  -------  -------   ----  --------  ------
  @site-a  "Site A"  ✓     45000ft²
  @site-b  "Site B"  ✓
  @site-c  "Site C"  ✓     62000ft²  "(804) 555-1234"

Note the columns are union of all tags shared by the entities.  Because not every
entity shares the same columns, we have sparse or null cells.  We could further
add grid level or column level meta.

The data above is encoded into Zinc as follows:

  ver:"3.0"
  id,       dis,       site,  area,      phone
  @site-a,  "Site A",  M,     45000ft²,  N
  @site-b,  "Site B",  M,     N,         N
  @site-c,  "Site C",  M,     62000ft²  "(804) 555-1234"

See `Zinc` and `Json` chapters for the details for grid encoding.

Defs [#defs]
************
All the data types are formally defined by name with a [def]`Defs`:
  - `marker`
  - `na`
  - `remove`
  - `bool`
  - `number`
  - `str`
  - `uri`
  - `ref`
  - `symbol`
  - `date`
  - `time`
  - `dateTime`
  - `coord`
  - `xstr`
  - `list`
  - `dict`
  - `grid`

[Subtyping]`Subtyping` is used to narrow the core kinds into tag definitions.  For
example all ref tags will subtype from `ref`.
