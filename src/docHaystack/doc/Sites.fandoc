Overview [#overview]
*********************
A *site* entity models a single facility using the `site` tag. A good rule of
thumb is to model any building with its own street address as its own site.
For example, a campus should be modeled with each building as a site, versus
treating the entire campus as one site.  But not all sites are buildings; a
site could be a street light, cell phone tower, etc.

Tags [#tags]
************
Core tags used with sites:

  - `geoAddr`: the geographic free-form address of the site (which might
    include other geolocation tags such as `geoCity` or `geoCoord`)
  - `tz`: the timezone where the site is located
  - `area`: square footage or square meters of the facility. This enables
    site normalization by area.
  - `weatherStationRef`: associate the site with a weather station to visualize
    weather conditions and perform weather based energy normalization
  - `yearBuilt`: four digit year in which the building was constructed
