Overview [#overview]
********************
Haystack 3 defined a total of 230 tags. Of these 181 remain unchanged.
The other 47 have been modified as follows.

These are renamed or turned into conjuncts:

  - airCooled => `airCooling`
  - chilledWaterCool => `chilledWaterCooling`
  - chilledWaterPlant => `chilled-water-plant`
  - constantVolume  => `constantAirVolume`
  - coolOnly => `coolingOnly`
  - dew => `dewPoint`
  - dxCool => `dxCooling`
  - elecHeat => `elecHeating`
  - elecPanel = `elec-panel`
  - gasHeat => `gasHeating`
  - hisInterpolate => `hisMode`
  - hotWaterHeat => `hotWaterHeating`
  - hotWaterPlant => `hot-water-plant`
  - hotWaterReheat => `hotWaterHeating`
  - mag => `magnitude`
  - oil => `fuelOil`
  - primaryLoop => `plantPrimaryLoop`
  - rooftop => `rtu`
  - secondaryLoop => `plantSecondaryLoop`
  - screw => `rotaryScrew`
  - steamHeat => `steamHeating`
  - steamPlant > `steam-plant`
  - sunrise => `daytime`
  - uv => `unitVent`
  - variableVolume => `variableAirVolume`

These tags are not ported yet:

  - circuit => [see networks]`#networks`
  - connection => [see networks]`#networks`
  - device1Ref => [see networks]`#networks`
  - device2Ref => [see networks]`#networks`

  - waterMeterLoad
  - weatherPoint => [see weather]`#weather`


Weather [#weather]
******************
In Hasytack 3 weather stations were modeled via the 'weather' tag and
their points were modeled via the 'weatherPoint' tag.  In Haystack 4 we
use the `weather` marker on the points as the `pointSubject`.  And stations
are modeled via the `weatherStation` tag.

Weather points are mapped from Haystack 3 to Haystack 4 as follows:

  Haystack 3            Haystack 4             Notes

See `weatherStation` children section for full list of points.

Lighting [#lighting]
********************
Most tags related to lighting have not been included pending the work
under [WG 705]`https://project-haystack.org/forum/topic/705`

Networks [#networks]
********************
Haystack 3 included a prototype for modeling networks, devices, and
connections between them.  It was never implemented by any vendors and
was not complete, so it has not been ported to Haystack 4.  However, some
of the core concepts are found in the 'phIct' library including:
  - `network`
  - `device`
  - `protocol`

Symbols [#symbols]
******************
Symbol is added as a new scalar type in Haystack 4.  In Zinc it is represented
as '^name' and in JSON with the "y:" prefix.  The format version was left
as "3.0" to minimize ecosystem distruption since symbols are only used with
defs and unlikely to occur in normal Haystack data.
